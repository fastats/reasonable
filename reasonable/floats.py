    `floats` is a replacement for the `hypothesis` `floats`
    function.

    It requires at least one positional argument, using the
    built-in `x` object available in `reasonable`.

    To use this `floats` function, set your constraints for
    min/max values using the `x`-object:

    .. code-block:: python

      floats(x > 1.0)
      floats(x <= 2.4)
      floats((50.0 < x) & (x < 70.0))

    .. note::
      In order to use multiple constraints, you must use the
      bit-wise operator `&` **not** the boolean statement `and`.
      This is a limitation of python in that `and` cannot be
      overloaded, but `&` can.
